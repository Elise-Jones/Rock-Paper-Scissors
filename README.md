# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The app allows users to play one the most classic games Rock, Paper, Scissors wherever they are and without needing a partner. The game includes two levels one with your classic fighters; rock, paper and scissors and a difficult version that includes an alien and a lizard to play with too. 

### Installation Instructions:

2. Clone down to your desired directory by commanding 
  `git@github.com:Elise-Jones/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git`
3. cd into the repository
4. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal


### Preview of App:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I had a week complete the project and I am currently in module 1 of Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM

3. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins
-Learning to build the data model before manipulating the DOM was an extremely beneficial learning experience.
- Creating a game that can be enjoyed by anyone. 

#### Challenges
- Connecting the data model to the dom at times was difficult but was able to update my data model to make everything work together.

- Determining where event listeners should go based on how the comp was supposed to look.
